XORCoin is programmed to be the most equitable P2P money and betting system, without monopoly by any persons and organizations(such as mining pools). The users of XORCoin play lottery&gambling on the block chain system, they send bets, send coins, or mining blocks, by using the xorcoin application.

It is these users who keep XORCoin decentralized. They individually run their own XORCoin full nodes, and each of those full nodes separately follows the exact same rules to decide which block chain is valid.

There’s no voting or other corruptible process involved: there’s just individual software following identical rules—”math”—to evaluate identical blocks and coming to identical conclusions about which block chain is valid.

This shared agreement (called consensus) allows people like you to only accept valid XOCs, enforcing XORCoin’s rules against even the most powerful miners(and mining pools). XORCoin using real decentralized mining algorithm, to make the betting system equitable.
